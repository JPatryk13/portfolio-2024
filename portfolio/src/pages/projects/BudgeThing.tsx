                    It started as an idea to help me understand where I my money go. I wanted to move away from dreadfully inputing every transaction into an Excel sheet, speed things up and remove potential errors. I began in 2023 building a <StyledLink href="https://github.com/JPatryk13/python-budgething-desktop">desktop interface</StyledLink> for extracting and aggregating transactional data from bank statements. I challenged myself to use  domain-driven design (DDD) and <StyledLink href="https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython-6/">PyQt</StyledLink>. I built an  interactive PDF reader that would be able to detect tables and allow user to intercept the stream of data that eventually would end up in a local, encrypted file. Soon after partially achieving this goal I understood that everyone could benefit from that tool. I transfered the business logic to a different repository and started working on an API. After couple of iterations of research, creating, reducing and expanding various components I completed the Minimum Viable Product and designed the next phases. Currently the API is deployed and I'm working on the front end of the application.
