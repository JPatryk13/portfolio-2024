# AI-powered Job Search Engine

My first attempt at automating processes with machine learning. The tool features (or will feature) multi-phrase search over a given number of jobs and ML search model via Hugging Face API. The result is evaluated based on similarity.

The online service I'm going to use as an examle here is going to be LinkedIn. The setup of the application will therefore require a LinkedIn account. 

The pipeline - as I like to call it - consists of couple of stages:

&emsp;1 [Extracting Job Info](#1-extracting-job-info)
&emsp;2 [Serialising and Streamlining Data](#2-serialising-and-streamlining-data)
&emsp;3 [Evaluating Score for Each Job](#3-evaluating-score-for-each-job)
&emsp;4 [Previewing Results](#4-previewing-results)

## 1 Extracting Job Info

I build a framework on top of Selenium.

## 3 Evaluating Score for Each Job
